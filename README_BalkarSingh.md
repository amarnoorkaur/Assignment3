COMP 359 AB1
Assignment 3 
Topic - Dynamic Programming for scoring spelling errors (or DNA alignment scores)

## Tools Used for Assignmet
- MS visual Studio Code
- Jet Brains Pycharm 
- MS Word (for Rearch and Final repot)
- VS Code Build in Regex module   
- Programming Language Python
- Github

## Programs Developed
    - levenshtein_algo.py ( Intial implement of Dynamic programming for Levenstien alrogrithn)
    - spellingsuggestion.py ( Application of levenstien alrgorithm for spelling error suggestion)


## Work Flow
- NOV 19, 2024 - Research on Dynamic Programming for scoring spelling error and Levenshtein algorithm for string comparisons. 
- Nov 22, 2024 - Implementation of levenshtein_algorithm function to perform operation: insertion, deletion, and substitution.
- Nov 23, 2024 - matrix genration and manupulation 
               - Change from static strings to UserInput Strings
- Nov 25, 2024 - Exploring to develop a program of spelling suggestion
               - Extended the Levenshtein algorithm to implement spelling suggestions function.
               - creating a dictionary file containing 1000 common english words.
- Nov 27, 2024 - Testing the levenshteinalgo.py and recording data for Final Report
- Nov 28, 2024 - Uploading/Updating Github Reposotry
               - Testing spelling suggestion with different dictionary files (changing words and range) and Worked on enhancing the spelling suggestion by moving from single length Strings to sentences 
               - Writing on Final Report
- Nov 29, 2024 - Finalizing Everything for submission

MS COPILOT - make more spelling error for this sentence

Generated - The recived invitaton to the ceremony was mispalced, causing unnecesary confsion and delaays.

You 
count words in "I defintely think we should recieve the package tommorow. "
and "The recived invitaton to the ceremony was mispalced, causing unnecesary confsion and delaays."


Generated - The word count for each sentence is as follows:

"I defintely think we should recieve the package tommorow." — 9 words
"The recived invitaton to the ceremony was mispalced, causing unnecesary confsion and delaays." — 13 words ​
