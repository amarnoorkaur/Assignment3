DNA Alignment:
Is the process of arranging 2 or more DNA sequences to identify the areas of similarity.

Matches: same sequence (high score indicates similarity while low score indicates unrelated sequence)
Mismatches: matches - nonmatches

Scoring scheme:
Match score: Points awarded for each matching nucleotide between the sequences (add 1 for each match)
Mismatch penalty: A negative score for each non-matching nucleotide which indicates a difference. (Subtract 1 for each mismatch)
Gap penalty: Gaps are inserted into a sequence alignment to account for insertions or deletions (indels) that may have occurred during the evolutionary process or to optimize the alignment score.  (Subtract 1 for each gap i.e. insertion/deletion (shown by - sign))
example: -s1: AGCT
         -s2: AG-T (to align s2 better with s1 - is introduced )

Global match: aligning the sequence end to end from starting to end. Needleman-Wunsch algorithm is used for global match. (global match is used when both the sequences are thought to have the same length)

local match: is used to find the area of the most similar region in two larger sequences. Smith-Waterman algorithm is used for local matching. 
example: S1: GGAGCTGACCC; S2:AGCTG
