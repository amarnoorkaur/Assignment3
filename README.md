Amarnoor's work:
Amarnoor worked on:
DNA scoring and alignment in Java language:

Global and Local alignment algorithms

1) Dynamic scoring

2) Decision making mechanism to choose which algorithm to use based on the difference in length. 

3) Traceback algorithm that extracts the optimal alignment

4) Visualization to depict the alignment

5) Execution time to measure the performance of algorithm
